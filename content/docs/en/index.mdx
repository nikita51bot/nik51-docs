title: About the Documentation
description: Why, what, and how
---

Welcome to the documentation for my projects!

## HOW CAN I BUILD SOMETHING LIKE THIS???

This documentation is built using the [Fumadocs](https://www.fumadocs.dev/) framework.

## Why was this documentation created?

Some of my projects needed additional explanations about their functionality,
usage, and underlying concepts — including descriptions, tables, and other useful information.
I wanted to present everything in a way that is clear and understandable for most users.

Since I’m not a big fan of the default Markdown styling, I started looking for
ways to create more visually appealing documentation.

## Why I chose this solution

Honestly, I started using Fumadocs because I immediately liked its design
and the existing components it provides. The framework allows me to build
documentation layouts quite easily while still giving me the flexibility
to create custom components using HTML and CSS when needed.

## Errors, inconsistencies, and other issues

If you notice any problems with the documentation — mistakes, inconsistencies,

I’m currently still learning React, Node.js, and the Fumadocs structure,
so any help or feedback is highly appreciated!
