The plugin includes additional functionality designed to provide more flexible
control over its behavior and features.

### List Mode

The list mode is used to restrict or allow players to perform patting actions by adding
players (or their UUIDs) to this list and selecting its operating mode.
It can function either as a whitelist or a blacklist.



(Other functionality will be described later)
