import { Plus, Minus, List } from 'lucide-react';

The list mode is used to restrict or grant permission to perform petting actions
by adding players (or their UUIDs) to the list and selecting its operating mode.
This list is stored in the `player-list.txt` file inside the config folder and
represents a list of players in the following format:

```markdown title="player-list.txt"
a4369612-4870-3833-9a0b-1f1073297c22 nikita51
192e3748-12d5-4573-a8a5-479cd394a1dc LopyMine
...
```

### Management Commands

#### View list info [#info]

```shell
/patpat list info
```

Displays the current players in the list and the active operating mode.

#### Add a player [#add]

```bash
/patpat list add "player|uuid"
```

Adds a player to the list by name or UUID.

#### Remove a player [#remove]

```shell
/patpat list remove "player|uuid"
```

Removes a player from the list.

#### Operating modes [#set]

```shell
/patpat list set "mode"
```

Changes the operating mode to one of the following:

- `BLACKLIST` — only players NOT in the list can perform petting
- `WHITELIST` — only players in the list can perform petting
- `DISABLED` — any player can perform petting
